            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Solid Drinking Library</h1><p>Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0273a33607950225cc804b6b0df8a694a29cdeef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Updating LA's Historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</h1><p>On the roster of storied LA hotels, The Hollywood Roosevelt ranks high on the list, with its blend of Old Hollywood lore and allure. From The Tower to The Cabanas beside their David Hockney-painted pool, the entire property has played host to private parties and even more private conversations that would ultimately impact the surrounding city.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e18d9f17a192906c94659ac2a9c4a14e6edef3b0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
